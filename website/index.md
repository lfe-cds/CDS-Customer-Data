# Customer Data Working Group (WG3)

This is the homepage of the [Customer Data Working Group (WG3)](https://github.com/lfe-cds/CDS-Customer-Data), part of the [Connected Data Specifications (CDS)](https://cds.lfenergy.org/), an [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project.

## Scope <a id="scope" href="#scope" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

This working group focuses on writing free, open specifications for providing utility customer data access, in order to facilitate energy management, reporting, and projects.

## Use Cases <a id="use-cases" href="#use-cases" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

We have defined several broad categories of [use cases]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}) we will focus on addressing, along with what customer data types and functionalities will need to be specified to accommodate those use cases.

* `Use Case 1` - [Energy Management]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-energy-management)
* `Use Case 2` - [Energy Projects]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-energy-projects)
* `Use Case 3` - [Grid Flexibility]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-grid-flexibility)
* `Use Case 4` - [Building Benchmarking]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-benchmarking)

We've also made a list of what data and functionality is specifically [not in scope]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#not-in-scope).

## Specifications <a id="specs" href="#specs" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

These are the official [specifications]({{ "/specs" | relative_url }}) written by this working group.

* `CDS-WG3-01` - Customer Data [[Overview]({{ "/specs/cds-wg3-01/overview" | relative_url }})] [[Specification]({{ "/specs/cds-wg3-01" | relative_url }})] `(in progress)`

If you would like to contribute to these specifications, please see our docs on [Contributing]({{ "/" | relative_url }}#contributing) and [Design Principles]({{ "specs/design-principles" | relative_url }}).
